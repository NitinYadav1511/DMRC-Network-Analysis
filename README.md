# Delhi Metro Network Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the **Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) Network** data from **2008 to 2019**. The dataset contains comprehensive information on various metro stations, including their locations, opening dates, lines, and other key attributes. The primary objective is to explore and gain insights into the growth, structure, and layout of the metro system in one of the largest metro networks in India.

## Problem Statement

The Delhi Metro has undergone rapid expansion since its inception, connecting multiple regions and millions of daily commuters. Understanding its network structure and patterns can reveal crucial information on:

- The **geographical spread** of metro lines.
- **Patterns in station opening dates**, which reflect the growth of the metro network over time.
- **Metro line characteristics**, such as which lines are elevated versus underground.
- **Spatial distribution** of stations and their distances from starting points.
- How the metro has facilitated **urban connectivity** across various parts of Delhi-NCR.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is from Kaggle. It contains 285 rows and 8 columns with the following attributes:

- **Station ID**: Unique identifier for each station.
- **Station Name**: Name of the metro station.
- **Distance from Start (km)**: Distance of the station from the starting point of the metro line.
- **Line**: The metro line (e.g., Red line, Blue line) to which the station belongs.
- **Opening Date**: The date when the station became operational.
- **Station Layout**: Indicates whether the station is elevated or underground.
- **Latitude and Longitude**: Geographical coordinates of the station.

## Analysis and Insights

The project performs a detailed analysis of the dataset, providing insights such as:

### Network Expansion Over Time

- Analysis of the number of stations opened each year across different metro lines.
- Identification of key growth periods for the Delhi Metro system.

### Station Layout Distribution

- A breakdown of how many stations are elevated versus underground.
- Correlations between metro lines and their station layouts.

### Geospatial Distribution

- Mapping the latitude and longitude coordinates of all stations to visualize the geographical spread of the network.
- Insights into how well-connected certain areas are, based on the density of stations.

### Line-wise Analysis

- A comparative study of various metro lines, including the number of stations, total distance covered, and station density along each line.

### Distance Patterns

- Exploration of how station distances vary within each line and the implications of these variations on connectivity and travel efficiency.

## Contributions of the Project

This project contributes towards:

- **Urban Planning**: Understanding the layout and spread of the metro can help planners identify underserved areas and plan future expansions.
- **Public Policy**: Insights on metro growth can inform decisions regarding transportation policies and infrastructure development in Delhi and other urban centers.
- **Transportation Networks**: The analysis serves as a case study for transportation network analysis, providing a framework for analyzing other metro systems around the world.
- **Commuter Insights**: The analysis of station locations and network expansion over time can provide valuable information to commuters regarding the evolution of metro connectivity.

## Conclusion

The analysis sheds light on the structure, expansion, and impact of the Delhi Metro network over the last decade. It provides actionable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and transportation researchers aiming to understand and improve mass transit systems.
